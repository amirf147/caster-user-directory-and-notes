This repository contains most of my user directory and some notes that I took early on in my caster journey which are mostly irrelevant nowadays.

Caster is an extension to the Dragonfly framework that allows you to control your computer with voice commands.

### Olympus RS31H Foot Pedal Control (AutoHotkey v2)

`foot_pedal.ahk` provides advanced control for the Olympus RS31H USB foot pedal, which maps its four pedals to the `F13`, `F14`, `F15`, and `F16` keyboard keys.

It is specifically designed to solve the common hardware issue where the pedal sends "bouncing" or repeated key events, making simple press-and-hold detection unreliable. This script implements a robust debouncing and polling method to provide clean tap, hold, and long-press actions.

#### Requirements

*   **AutoHotkey v2.0** or newer.
*   An **Olympus RS31H foot pedal** (or any other foot pedal that sends `F13` - `F16` key presses).
    *   In order to program keys beyond F12 on the RS31H, you need manually edit the XML configuration file.
*   **Enable ViaCam** with the cursor control keyboard shortcut (default: `F11`).

#### Pedal Mappings & Features

The script assigns the following "smart" actions to each pedal, with visual tooltips for feedback:

*   **Right Pedal (`F15`): Smart Left Click**
    *   **Short Tap (First Time):** Sends `F11`. This is useful for a one-time setup action. Specifically, **Enable ViaCam** with the cursor control keyboard shortcut (default: `F11`).
    *   **Short Tap (Subsequent):** Acts as a standard **Left Mouse Click**.
    *   **Press and Hold:** Initiates a **Left Mouse Drag**. Release the pedal to drop.

*   **Middle Pedal (`F14`): Scroll Down**
    *   **Short Tap:** Scrolls down one increment (`WheelDown`).
    *   **Press and Hold:** Scrolls down continuously until released.

*   **Top Pedal (`F16`): Scroll Up**
    *   **Short Tap:** Scrolls up one increment (`WheelUp`).
    *   **Press and Hold:** Scrolls up continuously until released.

*   **Left Pedal (`F13`): Smart Right Click & Reset**
    *   **Short Tap:** Acts as a standard **Right Mouse Click**.
    *   **Long Press:** Resets the state of the **Left Pedal (`F15`)** back to its "first tap sends `F11`" behavior. It also sends an `F11` immediately upon reset.

#### Configuration

All timing and behavior can be easily adjusted by editing the variables in the `--- Config ---` section at the top of the script file.

*   `F15_HoldDelay`: Time in milliseconds to hold the Right Pedal to begin a drag-and-drop.
*   `F13_HoldDelay`: Time in milliseconds to long-press the Left Pedal to trigger the reset action.
*   `Scroll_HoldDelay`: Time in milliseconds to hold a scroll pedal before continuous scrolling begins.
*   `Scroll_RepeatRate`: Time in milliseconds between each scroll tick during a hold. **A smaller value results in faster scrolling.**

Note: Yes, I prefer to use my right foot for clicking and my left foot for right clicking and stopping cursor tracking
