## Current Status (25 July 2024, see status-updates-history.md for previous status updates) 
Still using this full time, adding or modifying rules as needs arise. Switched to using the talon alphabet except a few letters, see words.txt in transformers directory. I've noticed that a lot of the transforms that I did in words.txt had to slowly be undone because they made sense in windows speech recognition because of poor recognition accuracy but as smy capabilities increased in using Caster and hs I've been increasing my command vocabulary, I've noticed that a lot of the specs are the words they are for good reason, for example because ofnot colliding with other specs or maybe just less voice straining. I'm thinking I might soon  
revert to the default spec, "bird", for jumping back one word (control + left arrow), as I have currently been using "blush" which was less misrecognized in windows speech recognition. I've noticed that it can take up to a week and sometimes longer to get used to a new spec that replaces one that you've been used to saying for a long time. It is however worth the struggle in the long run if it is an improvement in either reducing complexity or reducing voice strain. 

## About Me
I have previously relied on Windows Speech Recognition (WSR) and Windows Speech Recognition Macros for using the computer but now I would like to transition away from using these programs. You can view my collection of macros for WSR here: https://github.com/amirf147/wsrmacros. I am new to both Dragonfly and Caster. The final outcome of this transition away from WSR remains to be seen.

## Window Switching
I use numbered win keys for window switching with the following
modifications to the taskbar in Windows 10:
- From windows settings app: Never combine taskbar buttons
- From windows settings app: Vertical taskbar on the right side
- From windows settings app: Small taskbar buttons
- Windhawk mod: "Disable grouping on the taskbar". This prevent the thumbnail preview pop up when you press a windows key plus a number
- Zero pinned items on the taskbar
- Taskbar size minimized using drag-to-resize
