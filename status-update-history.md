## Current Status (25 July 2024, see status-updates-history.md for previous status updates) 
Still using this full time, adding or modifying rules as needs arise. Switched to using the talon alphabet except a few letters, see words.txt in transformers directory. I've noticed that a lot of the transforms that I did in words.txt had to slowly be undone because they made sense in windows speech recognition because of poor recognition accuracy but as smy capabilities increased in using Caster and hs I've been increasing my command vocabulary, I've noticed that a lot of the specs are the words they are for good reason, for example because ofnot colliding with other specs or maybe just less voice straining. I'm thinking I might soon  
revert to the default spec, "bird", for jumping back one word (control + left arrow), as I have currently been using "blush" which was less misrecognized in windows speech recognition. I've noticed that it can take up to a week and sometimes longer to get used to a new spec that replaces one that you've been used to saying for a long time. It is however worth the struggle in the long run if it is an improvement in either reducing complexity or reducing voice strain. 

## Current Status (30 May 2024) 
I have added a significant portion of the core customizations that I require for enabling my full time usage of this accessibility tool. I am still switching between usage of kaldi-dragonfly-grammars, wsrmacros and this. I have noticed that there is a little noticeable latency increase when using caster as opposed to just using bare-bones dragonfly but I believe the benefits of using caster will ultimately outweigh this latency increase.

I am still using and developing https://github.com/amirf147/kaldi-dragonfly-gammars for full handsfree computer control. I just created this repository to document/store my Caster user directory (https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/User_Dir/Caster_User_Dir/) as I begin learning and using Caster. It may be that I eventually switch to just using Caster for my computer control needs.
