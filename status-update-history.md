## Current Status (30 May 2024) 
I have added a significant portion of the core customizations that I require for enabling my full time usage of this accessibility tool. I am still switching between usage of kaldi-dragonfly-grammars, wsrmacros and this. I have noticed that there is a little noticeable latency increase when using caster as opposed to just using bare-bones dragonfly but I believe the benefits of using caster will ultimately outweigh this latency increase.

I am still using and developing https://github.com/amirf147/kaldi-dragonfly-gammars for full handsfree computer control. I just created this repository to document/store my Caster user directory (https://caster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readthedocs/User_Dir/Caster_User_Dir/) as I begin learning and using Caster. It may be that I eventually switch to just using Caster for my computer control needs.
