# 🏚️ Attic

This folder contains code that’s been temporarily shelved—unfinished features, experimental ideas, or logic that didn’t quite pan out (yet).

## Purpose

- Preserve work that might be useful later
- Avoid cluttering the main codebase
- Keep a record of past attempts or alternate approaches

## Guidelines

- Code here may be incomplete, buggy, or deprecated
- Feel free to revisit, refactor, or revive anything inside
- Add a short note to each file explaining its status or intent

## Contents

- `window_management/`: An attempt at building a window management system using the pyautogui library using claude opus 4 to generate the code in combination with software engineering turn-based prompts.
